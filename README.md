Day-Planner-APP
Day Planner App is a cross-platform task management application built using Flutter, inspired by Microsoft To Do. It allows users to create, organize, and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app includes several task sections such as My Day, Important, Planned, Assigned to Me, and a general Tasks section. Users can add tasks with specific times, select a day of the week from a dropdown, and choose a date using a calendar picker. Tasks scheduled for the current day automatically appear under the "My Day" section.

This app is built using Flutter 3.32.0 and Dart, following Material Design principles. It supports multiple platforms including Android, Windows, and Web (Chrome, Edge). To run the app, clone the repository, navigate into the project folder, run flutter pub get, and then launch it using flutter run. It can be run on an emulator, physical Android device, or in a browser. The project is structured into logical folders like models, widgets, and utils to maintain clean code organization.

Whether you're looking to manage your tasks efficiently or contribute to an open-source Flutter project, Day Planner App is a great starting point. Contributions are welcome, and the project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
